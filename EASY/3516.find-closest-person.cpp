 * [3516] Find Closest Person
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/description/
 *
 * Category: algorithms
 * Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the positions of
 * three people on a number line:
 * 
 * 
 * x is the position of Person 1.
 * y is the position of Person 2.
 * z is the position of Person 3, who does not move.
 * 
 * 
 * Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.
 * 
 * Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:
 * 
 * 
 * Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
 * Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
 * Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the result accordingly.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4
 * 
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 
 * Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2
 * steps.
 * Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.
 * 
 * 
 * Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 2, y = 5, z = 6
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 
 * Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 6) in 4
 * steps.
 * Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 1 step.
 * 
 * 
 * Since Person 2 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3
 * 
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 
 * Person 1 is at position 1 and can reach Person 3 (at position 3) in 2
 * steps.
 * Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 2 steps.
 * 
 * 
 * Since both Person 1 and Person 2 reach Person 3 at the same time, the output
 * is 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= x, y, z <= 100
 * 
 *
